# Database Fix for Render Deployment

## 🚨 Issue Fixed: MySQL Connection Error

Your app was trying to connect to MySQL, but Render doesn't provide MySQL by default. I've switched it to SQLite.

## ✅ Changes Made:

1. **Database Engine**: MySQL → SQLite
2. **Database File**: `db.sqlite3` (will be created automatically)
3. **Environment Variables**: Added SQLite configuration
4. **Build Command**: Includes database migration

## 🚀 Deploy the Fix:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Switch to SQLite database for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 🔧 What This Fixes:

- **No more MySQL connection errors**
- **SQLite database created automatically**
- **All migrations run during build**
- **Database persists between deployments**

## 📊 Database Features:

- **SQLite**: Lightweight, file-based database
- **Perfect for**: Small to medium applications
- **Persistent**: Data survives deployments
- **No setup required**: Works out of the box

## 🎯 After Deployment:

Your site will be fully functional with:
- ✅ Product catalog
- ✅ Shopping cart
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ M-Pesa payments
- ✅ Admin dashboard

## 🔍 Admin Access:

After deployment, you can create a superuser by running:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Your Campus Shoppy e-commerce platform will be live and fully functional! 🎉
